/**
 * Used to define player-key mappings. A fully configured instance of this class is needed for KeyHandler to
 * function.
 *
 * This class is supposed to be used like this:
 * // Define your players.
 * object RedPlayer extends Player
 * object BluePlayer extends Player
 *
 * // Define the keys. These are logical keys like "steer left", "steer right" or "fire", not the actual keys
 * // on the keyboard.
 * object LeftKey extends Key
 * object RightKey extends Key
 * object FireKey extends Key
 *
 * // Now that we know our keys and our players we can define the mappings between players, keys and physical
 * // keys.
 * val keyMap = (new KeyMap)
 *         .addMapping(RedPlayer, LeftKey, KeyEvent.VK_A) // the 'a' key steers red player to the left
 *         .addMapping(RedPlayer, RightKey, KeyEvent.VK_D) // the 'd' key steers the red player to the right
 *         .addMapping(RedPlayer, FireKey, KeyEvent.VK_W) // red player fires with 'w' key
 *         .addMapping(BluePlayer, LeftKey, KeyEvent.VK_LEFT) // define left key for blue player
 *         .addMapping(BluePlayer, RightKey, KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT) // ...
 *         .addMapping(BluePlayer, FireKey, KeyEvent.VK_UP)
 *
 * // Initialize the key handler.
 * val keyHandler = new KeyHandler(keyMap)
 *
 * The KeyEvent class mentioned in the example is java.awt.event.KeyEvent from the Java standard library.
