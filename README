PiccoInput is a small library written in Scala (http://scala-lang.org/). It acts as an event handler for input events from the Piccolo2D scene graph (Java version).
PiccoInput hides the complexity of Piccolo's event-based input model and provides an API that allow you to easily poll for currently pressed keys from your main loop.

PiccoInput was designed for rather simple games written in Scala. It is probably usable from Java, but the API has a certain "Scala smell" to it, so I don't think this would be a pleasant experience.
